// Per-book event-stream contract for the accounting plugin — the
// reusable channel-name factory + event-kind enum + payload shape.
// Single source of truth for both publishers (the package's server
// surface, `eventPublisher`) and subscribers (the Vue View's
// `useAccountingChannel`), so anyone branching on event kind imports
// from here and the type system catches drift on either side.
//
// Lives in the package's `./shared` (browser-safe) rather than the
// host META because the backend needs it too — keeping it host-side
// would force an uphill import. The host-wiring META (toolName /
// apiNamespace / workspaceDirs / staticChannels) stays in the host's
// `src/plugins/accounting/meta.ts` so the plugin-barrel codegen
// discovers it.
//
// Browser-safe: no Vue imports, no server-only imports.
